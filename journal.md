# Proposed challenges
Many of these challenges are variants of domain transfer problems. Target domain is always medieval illuminations. Source domain depends on the application.

## Applications
### Single photo restyling
**Source domains:** face close-up photo; person photo.

Pipeline can be: a) do mattting b) style transfer c) blend back. This should transfer pose and appearance.

###  Animoji
**Source domain:** face pose and keypoints.

Given a controlled reference target face appearance, this should transfer pose only.

### VJ
**Source domains:** whole body pose; sketch of face / person; colored sketch of the scene

Given controlled appearance, this should allow to animate the avatar.

Extra: detection of multiple person sketches; good person pose parametrization.
